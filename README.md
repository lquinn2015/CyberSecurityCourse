# CyberSecurity_Week9_Assignment

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and provide an exfil data.

### Required: writeup 
- For this assignment I setup Honey pot via gcloud. On the admin console I setup 3 honeypots dianos, Snort and ....One major issue is that running mongeDB on my admin client crashed and corrupted my system so i had to reset my honeypot the day before the project was due. Other than that I only resceived on port.
- One Issue i have been unable to resolve is exfilling data from the admin VM. Currently running mongeDB crashes my admin console and renders thte VM useless.  
- Reinstalling seemed to fix that issue
